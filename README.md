# Portfolio using the Accessible Astro Starter

For this personal website, I am using the [Accessible Astro Starter](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-starter) by [Mark Teekman](https://github.com/markteekman) with a few small adjustments. 

If you are curious about using the starter yourself, you can checkout a preview here in the 
ðŸš€ [Live Preview](https://accessible-astro.netlify.app/)

Find a mistake, have some suggestions for improvements or ways to make this site more accessible? I am always eager to learn, please let me know - my [dms](https://twitter.com/JsfnSchfr) are open ðŸ¤—
