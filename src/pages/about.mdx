# Hi, nice to meet you!

# 

Hey there, I'm Josefine, a front-end developer and accessibility advocate based in Hamburg, Germany. 

I strongly believe in the power of technology to build inclusive communities, and I'm actively involved as a Women Tech Makers & GirlCode Ambassador, and Google Developer Expert for Web Technologies. 

Currently, I'm working at Storyblok as an Accessibility Engineer, where I get to combine my technical skills with my dedication to accessibility. I love the challenge of making the web more inclusive, creating accessible user experiences and a welcoming environment for everyone. 

I have been so fortunate to be able to travel the world speaking about web accessibility & creating inclusive communities, which I could not be more grateful for. I love sharing knowledge, exchanging ideas & meeting community members at conferences & meetups. I believe that education and awareness are key to driving positive change in the tech industry.

When I am not working in tech, I am teaching & training aerial acrobatics at our local dance studio, baking, reading, or hanging out outdoors.  

So, whether you're interested in frontend development, and accessibility, or just want to chat about creating a more inclusive web, feel free to reach out. Let's work together to make the digital world a better place for everyone!
