        Hey there, I'm Josefine, a front-end developer and accessibility advocate based in Hamburg, Germany. I strongly
        believe in the power of technology to build inclusive communities, and I'm actively involved as a <a href="https://developers.google.com/womentechmakers/ambassadors/directory">Women Tech
        Makers</a> & <a href="https://www.girl-code.co.uk/">GirlCode Ambassador</a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts">Google Developer Expert</a> for Web Technologies. Currently, I'm working at
        Storyblok as an Accessibility Engineer, where I get to combine my technical skills with my dedication to
        accessibility. I love the challenge of making the web more inclusive, creating accessible user experiences and a
        welcoming environment for everyone. I have been so fortunate to be able to travel the world speaking about web
        accessibility & creating inclusive communities, which I could not be more grateful for. I love sharing
        knowledge, exchanging ideas & meeting community members at conferences & meetups. I believe that education and
        awareness are key to driving positive change in the tech industry. When I am not working in tech, I am teaching
        & training aerial acrobatics at our local dance studio, baking, reading, or hanging out outdoors. So, whether
        you're interested in frontend development, and accessibility, creating a more
        inclusive web or just want to chat about being a woman in tech, feel free to reach out. Let's work together to make the digital world a better place for
        everyone!
